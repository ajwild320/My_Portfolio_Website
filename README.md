## Introduction

I am Austin Wild, a software engineer with a degree in computer science from The University of North Carolina at Charlotte. I have a passion for programming and have worked on various projects ranging from web development to mobile applications. This portfolio is a compilation of some of my work and experiences.

This website was built based upon the work of Adrian Hajdin. The video here and the resources within are how I learned to build this amazing application!
